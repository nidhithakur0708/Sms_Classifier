In this reposistory I have made a machine learning model for SMS classifiication as ham or spam.
The machine learning model uses Logistic regression algorithm.The model is made in various parts which include data preprocessing,data cleaning,model fitting followed by model evaluation.The model gives around 96% accuracy on both training and testing data.
The data set used for the model is given in this repository and is taken from kaggle.
